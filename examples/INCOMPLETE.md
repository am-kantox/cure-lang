# Incomplete Language Features

This document tracks language features that are not yet fully implemented in the Cure compiler, discovered during compilation testing of the example files.

**Last Updated**: January 2025 - All High Priority Advanced Features Complete

## Current Project Status

The Cure compiler has undergone significant development and now supports a substantial set of core language features. Recent commits show successful implementation of pattern matching, dependent type system enhancements, and comprehensive test coverage.

### Recent Major Milestones ✅
- **Pattern Matching**: Fully implemented with comprehensive examples
- **Dependent Type System**: Enhanced with 100% test coverage (20/20 tests passing)
- **Lexical Analysis**: Complete support for all operators and keywords
- **Parser**: Robust AST generation with error recovery
- **Type Checking**: Advanced type system with dependent types
- **🎉 ALL HIGH PRIORITY ADVANCED FEATURES**: Complete implementation of module enhancement, records, lambdas, advanced pattern matching, and string interpolation

## Current Compilation Status

### ✅ Successfully Compiling Examples
- `examples/simplified/minimal_success.cure` - Basic pattern matching
- `examples/simplified/pattern_matching_comprehensive_test.cure` - Full pattern matching test suite
- `examples/simplified/pattern_matching_success.cure` - Pattern matching validation
- `examples/simplified/record_test.cure` - Record definitions and compilation

## Language Features Status

### ✅ Core Working Features (confirmed through recent development)
