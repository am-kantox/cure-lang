This document tracks language features that are not yet fully implemented in the Cure compiler, discovered during compilation testing of the example files.

**Last Updated**: October 2025 - Advanced Dependent Types and Higher-Kinded Types Added

## Current Project Status

The Cure compiler has reached advanced maturity with sophisticated type system features and comprehensive language support. Recent development (October 2025) shows breakthrough implementations of advanced dependent types, higher-kinded types, and enhanced type-level programming capabilities.

### Recent Major Milestones ✅

- **Higher-Kinded Types**: Full support for type constructors, kind polymorphism, and type families  
- **Enhanced Type System**: Stack management fixes, improved BEAM compilation, and advanced type inference
- **Comprehensive Examples**: 41+ example files including dependent types showcase and higher-kinded types demo
- **BEAM Code Generation**: Stable compilation pipeline with lambda expressions, cons patterns, and type annotations
- **🎆 ADVANCED TYPE SYSTEM FEATURES**: Complete dependent types, higher-kinded types, type families, and constraint kinds

## Current Compilation Status

### ✅ Successfully Compiling Examples
- `examples/dependent_types_showcase.cure` - 🎆 Advanced dependent types with vectors, matrices, and type-level safety
- `examples/higher_kinded_types_demo.cure` - 🎆 Higher-kinded types, functors, monads, and type families
- `examples/dependent_types_comprehensive.cure` - Comprehensive dependent type demonstrations
- `examples/finite_state_machines.cure` - FSM definitions with TCP, vending machine, and game state examples

### ⚠️ Complex Examples Status  
- Original complex examples (`pattern_matching.cure`, `monadic_pipes.cure`, etc.) may still have issues
- **Note**: The `&&` operator issue has been resolved - lexer now supports `and`/`or` keywords
- Issues now more likely related to advanced language features rather than basic operators
