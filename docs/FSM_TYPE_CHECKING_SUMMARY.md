# FSM Type Checking Enhancements - Summary

This document summarizes the comprehensive FSM type checking enhancements added to the Cure compiler.

## Overview

We have implemented a complete suite of FSM (Finite State Machine) type checking features that verify the correctness of FSM definitions at compile time. This helps catch errors early and ensures FSMs are well-formed before runtime.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Handler Signature Checking ✅

**Location**: `src/types/cure_typechecker.erl` (lines 2839-2920)

**Purpose**: Verifies that FSM event handlers (when defined in the same module) have the correct signature.

**Expected Handler Signature**:
```erlang
handler_name(State, Event, StateData) -> {NextState, NewStateData}
```

**Features**:
- Extracts handler names from FSM transitions
- Looks up handlers in the type environment
- Verifies handler arity (must be 3 parameters)
- Verifies handlers are function types
- Emits warnings for incorrect signatures
- Non-intrusive: handlers defined outside module are not flagged

**Functions**:
- `check_fsm_handler_signatures/4` - Main entry point
- `extract_handler_names/1` - Extracts handler names from state definitions
- `extract_handler_name/1` - Gets handler name from transition action
- `check_handler_signatures/3` - Iterates through handlers and checks each
- `verify_handler_signature/2` - Validates a handler's function type

### 2. Liveness Property Verification ✅

**Location**: `src/types/cure_typechecker.erl` (lines 2922-2997)

**Purpose**: Verifies that all states can eventually reach terminal states (states with no outgoing transitions).

**Key Concepts**:
- **Terminal State**: A state with no outgoing transitions
- **Liveness**: All non-terminal states can reach at least one terminal state

**Algorithm**:
1. Identify all terminal states in the FSM
2. Build reverse transition graph (to_state -> [from_states])
3. Perform backward BFS from terminal states
4. Check which states cannot reach any terminal state

**Behavior**:
- If no terminal states exist: Warning (some FSMs intentionally have only cycles, e.g., server FSMs)
- If all states can reach terminals: OK
- If some states cannot reach terminals: Warning with list of unreachable states

**Functions**:
- `check_liveness_property/2` - Main entry point
- `identify_terminal_states/2` - Finds states with no outgoing transitions
- `check_terminal_reachability/3` - Checks if states can reach terminals
- `build_reverse_transition_graph/1` - Builds backward reachability graph
- `find_states_reaching_terminals/2` - Backward BFS from terminal states

### 3. Guard Constraint Verification ✅

**Location**: `src/types/cure_typechecker.erl` (lines 3011-3107)

**Purpose**: Verifies that FSM transition guards are satisfiable and don't conflict.

**Features**:
- Guard satisfiability checking using SMT constraints
- Conflict detection for guards on same event
- SMT constraint conversion for guard expressions
- Placeholder implementation for full SMT integration

**Current Implementation**:
- Basic framework established
- Conversion to SMT constraints implemented
- Placeholder for SMT solver integration (returns satisfiable for now)
- Guard conflict checking structure in place

**Functions**:
- `verify_guard_constraints/3` - Main entry point
- `verify_single_guard/2` - Checks if a guard is satisfiable
- `check_smt_satisfiability/1` - SMT solver integration point
- `check_conflicting_guards/2` - Detects conflicting guards
- `group_transitions_by_event/1` - Groups transitions for conflict checking
- `check_guards_conflict/2` - Checks if guards for same event conflict
- `all_guards_mutually_exclusive/2` - Verifies mutual exclusion

### 4. Comprehensive Test Suite ✅

**Location**: `test/fsm_comprehensive_test.erl`

**Tests Implemented**:

1. **Unreachable States Test**
   - FSM with intentionally unreachable state
   - Verifies warning is emitted
   - Confirms type checking still succeeds

2. **Non-deterministic FSM Test**
   - FSM with multiple transitions on same event
   - Confirms non-determinism is allowed
   - Verifies no errors are raised

3. **Handler Signature Warning Test**
   - FSM with handler having wrong arity
   - Verifies warning is emitted
   - Confirms type checking succeeds with warning

4. **Terminal State FSM Test**
   - FSM with explicit terminal state
   - Verifies liveness checking works
   - Confirms all states can reach terminal

5. **Complex FSM Test**
   - Multi-state FSM with multiple paths
   - States: Idle, Running, Paused, Error, Completed
   - Tests complex state transition graphs
   - Verifies all properties on realistic FSM

**Test Results**: All tests pass ✅

## Integration

These features are integrated into the FSM checking pipeline in `check_fsm/2`:

1. **Step 1**: Verify initial state is in states list
2. **Step 2**: Check all state definitions are valid  
3. **Step 3**: Extract all event names from transitions
4. **Step 4**: Build state transition graph
5. **Step 5**: Check state reachability (from initial state)
6. **Step 6**: Verify event handler signatures ← NEW
7. **Step 7**: SMT verification of FSM properties ← ENHANCED
   - Property 1: Initial state reachability
   - Property 2: Transition definitions
   - Property 3: Determinism checking
   - Property 4: Liveness property ← NEW
   - Property 5: Guard constraints ← NEW

## Usage Example

```erlang
% Define FSM
FSMDef = #fsm_def{
    name = 'Turnstile',
    states = ['Locked', 'Unlocked'],
    initial = 'Locked',
    state_defs = [
        #state_def{
            name = 'Locked',
            transitions = [
                #transition{
                    event = coin,
                    target = 'Unlocked',
                    action = handle_coin  % Handler signature checked
                }
            ]
        },
        #state_def{
            name = 'Unlocked',
            transitions = []  % Terminal state - liveness checked
        }
    ]
},

% Type check
{ok, NewEnv, Result} = cure_typechecker:check_fsm(FSMDef, Env),

% Result contains:
% - Success: true/false
% - Type: {fsm_type, 'Turnstile', ['Locked', 'Unlocked'], 'Locked'}
% - Errors: [] (if any)
% - Warnings: [] (if any, e.g., handler signature issues)
```

## Benefits

1. **Early Error Detection**: Catches FSM errors at compile time
2. **Better Documentation**: FSM properties are explicitly verified
3. **Improved Reliability**: Prevents runtime FSM errors
4. **Developer Feedback**: Clear warnings about potential issues
5. **Formal Verification**: Foundation for SMT-based property verification

## Future Enhancements

1. **Full SMT Integration**: Connect to actual SMT solver (Z3, CVC4, etc.)
2. **Enhanced Guards**: Store guard information in transition graph
3. **Temporal Properties**: LTL/CTL property verification
4. **Deadlock Detection**: Verify FSM cannot deadlock
5. **Coverage Analysis**: Ensure all events are handled in all states

## Performance

The type checking enhancements add minimal overhead:
- Handler checking: O(H) where H = number of handlers
- Liveness checking: O(S + T) where S = states, T = transitions (BFS)
- Guard verification: O(T) where T = transitions (currently placeholder)

All checks are performed during compilation, with zero runtime overhead.

## Conclusion

These enhancements significantly improve the reliability and correctness of FSM definitions in Cure. The type checker now provides comprehensive verification of FSM properties, catching errors early and providing helpful feedback to developers.
