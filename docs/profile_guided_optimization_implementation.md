## 🔧 Implementation Details

### 1. Runtime Profile Collection System

The profile collection system gathers comprehensive runtime execution data:

```erlang
%% Initialize profile collection system
init_profile_collector() ->
    #{
        execution_counts => #{},        % Function execution counts
        call_frequencies => #{},        % Call frequency analysis
        hot_paths => [],               % Identified hot execution paths
        memory_access_patterns => #{}, % Memory access profiling
        type_usage_runtime => #{},     % Runtime type usage statistics
        performance_metrics => #{},    % Performance measurements
        adaptive_decisions => #{},     % Adaptive optimization decisions
        feedback_history => []         % Historical feedback data
    }.
```

#### Profile Data Collection

```erlang
collect_runtime_profiles(AST, AdaptiveContext) ->
    % Analyze function call patterns
    CallPatterns = analyze_function_call_patterns(AST),
    
    % Estimate execution frequencies
    ExecutionFrequencies = estimate_execution_frequencies(AST, CallPatterns),
    
    % Identify hot execution paths
    HotPaths = identify_runtime_hot_paths(AST, ExecutionFrequencies),
    
    % Analyze memory access patterns
    MemoryPatterns = analyze_memory_access_patterns(AST),
    
    % Collect type usage statistics
    RuntimeTypeUsage = collect_runtime_type_usage(AST).
```

### 2. Feedback-driven Function Specialization

Adaptive specialization creates optimized function versions based on runtime behavior:

```erlang
%% Generate adaptive specializations
generate_adaptive_specializations(Opportunities, ExistingOptimizations) ->
    maps:fold(fun(FuncName, OpportunityData, Acc) ->
        case maps:is_key(FuncName, ExistingSpecs) of
            true ->
                % Enhance existing specialization with runtime feedback
                EnhancedSpec = enhance_existing_specialization(FuncName, OpportunityData, ExistingSpecs);
            false ->
                % Create new adaptive specialization
                NewSpec = create_adaptive_specialization(FuncName, OpportunityData)
        end
    end, [], Opportunities).
```

#### Specialization Enhancement

- **Runtime Frequency Analysis**: Functions called frequently get specialized versions
- **Type Pattern Recognition**: Common type usage patterns drive specialization
- **Benefit-Cost Calculation**: Dynamic cost-benefit analysis guides specialization decisions

### 3. Dynamic Hot Path Optimization

Hot path optimization dynamically identifies and optimizes frequently executed code paths:

```erlang
%% Generate dynamic hot path optimizations
generate_dynamic_hot_path_optimizations(HotPathOpportunities, ProfileCollector) ->
    lists:map(fun({HotPath, OpportunityData}) ->
        Potential = maps:get(potential, OpportunityData),
        
        Optimization = case Potential of
            P when P > 3.0 ->
                #{type => aggressive_inline, path => HotPath, benefit => P};
            P when P > 2.0 ->
                #{type => specialized_codegen, path => HotPath, benefit => P};
            P when P > 1.5 ->
                #{type => register_allocation, path => HotPath, benefit => P};
            _ ->
                #{type => basic_optimization, path => HotPath, benefit => Potential}
        end
    end, HotPathOpportunities).
```

#### Hot Path Optimization Types

1. **Aggressive Inline** (Potential > 3.0): Complete function inlining for maximum performance
2. **Specialized Code Generation** (Potential > 2.0): Type-specific code generation
3. **Register Allocation** (Potential > 1.5): Optimized register usage
4. **Basic Optimization** (Potential ≤ 1.5): Standard optimization techniques

### 4. Adaptive Memory Layout Optimization

Memory layout optimization adapts data structure layouts based on runtime access patterns:

```erlang
%% Analyze access patterns for layout optimization
analyze_access_pattern(AccessPattern) ->
    TotalAccesses = maps:get(total_accesses, AccessPattern, 0),
    SequentialPattern = maps:get(sequential_pattern, AccessPattern, false),
    
    case {SequentialPattern, TotalAccesses} of
        {true, N} when N > 50 -> {sequential, high_frequency};
        {false, N} when N > 100 -> {random, high_volume};
        {_, N} when N > 20 -> {locality_heavy, medium};
        _ -> {unknown, low}
    end.
```

#### Layout Optimization Types

- **Cache Optimized**: For sequential, high-frequency access patterns
- **Memory Optimized**: For random, high-volume access patterns  
- **Locality Optimized**: For locality-heavy access patterns
- **Standard Layout**: Default layout for unknown patterns

### 5. Performance Feedback Integration

The feedback system continuously monitors performance and adapts optimization strategies:

```erlang
%% Create performance feedback system
create_performance_feedback_system(FeedbackData) ->
    #{
        feedback_data => FeedbackData,
        monitoring_enabled => true,
        feedback_interval => 1000, % milliseconds
        adaptation_threshold => 0.15, % 15% performance change threshold
        feedback_history_size => 100,
        performance_metrics => init_performance_metrics(),
        adaptive_decisions => []
    }.
```

#### Performance Targets

```erlang
init_performance_targets() ->
    #{
        execution_time_target => 1.0,   % Relative to baseline
        memory_usage_target => 0.8,     % 20% reduction from baseline
        throughput_target => 1.2,       % 20% improvement
        latency_target => 0.9,          % 10% reduction
        cache_hit_rate_target => 0.95   % 95% cache hit rate
    }.
```

## 📊 Optimization Decision Engine

### Adaptive Thresholds

The system uses adaptive thresholds that adjust based on runtime behavior:

```erlang
init_adaptive_thresholds() ->
    #{
        hot_function_threshold => 100,     % Minimum calls to consider hot
        specialization_benefit_threshold => 2.0,
        memory_optimization_threshold => 0.2, % 20% memory usage improvement
        performance_improvement_threshold => 0.1, % 10% performance improvement
        adaptation_sensitivity => 0.05  % 5% change sensitivity
    }.
```

### Priority Calculation

Optimizations are prioritized based on combined benefit and frequency analysis:

```erlang
calculate_optimization_priorities(SpecializationOps, HotPathOps, MemoryOps) ->
    AllOpportunities = [
        {specialization, maps:to_list(SpecializationOps)},
        {hot_path, HotPathOps},
        {memory, maps:to_list(MemoryOps)}
    ],
    
    % Sort by combined benefit and frequency
    lists:sort(fun({_, OpsA}, {_, OpsB}) ->
        calculate_combined_priority(OpsA) > calculate_combined_priority(OpsB)
    end, AllOpportunities).
```
