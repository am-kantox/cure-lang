## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

#### 1. SMT Solver Module (`src/types/cure_smt_solver.erl`)

The main SMT solver implementation provides a complete constraint solving infrastructure:

**Key Records:**
```erlang
-record(smt_constraint, {
    type :: equality | inequality | arithmetic | logical,
    left :: smt_term(),
    op :: '=' | '<' | '>' | '<=' | '>=' | '/=' | '+' | '-' | '*' | 'and' | 'or' | 'implies',
    right :: smt_term(),
    location :: location()
}).

-record(smt_term, {
    type :: variable | constant | expression,
    value :: atom() | integer() | float() | smt_expression(),
    location :: location()
}).

-record(smt_expression, {
    op :: '+' | '-' | '*' | '/' | 'mod',
    args :: [smt_term()],
    location :: location()
}).
```

**Core API Functions:**
- `solve_constraints/1,2` - Main constraint solving interface
- `check_satisfiable/1` - Single constraint satisfiability checking
- `prove_constraint/2` - Proof assistance functionality
- Constraint construction: `arithmetic_constraint/3`, `equality_constraint/2`, `implication_constraint/2`

#### 2. Pattern Matching Integration

Advanced pattern matching constraint inference for dependent types:

```erlang
%% Infer length constraints from list patterns
infer_pattern_length({list_pattern, Elements, Tail, _}, ListLengthVar) ->
    % [a, b, c] -> length = 3
    % [a, b | xs] -> length = 2 + length(xs)
    % [a, b | _] -> length >= 2
```

#### 3. Proof Assistant

Built-in proof assistant with multiple proof strategies:
- **Direct Proof**: Goal follows directly from assumptions
- **Proof by Contradiction**: Assume negation leads to contradiction
- **Arithmetic Inference**: Specialized rules for numerical constraints
- **Transitivity/Symmetry**: Equality reasoning

### Integration Architecture

#### Type System Integration (`src/types/cure_types.erl`)

The SMT solver integrates seamlessly with Cure's type system:

```erlang
%% Partition constraints into type and arithmetic constraints
partition_constraints(Constraints) ->
    {TypeConstraints, ArithmeticConstraints}.

%% Solve arithmetic constraints via SMT solver
solve_arithmetic_constraints(ArithmeticConstraints, _TypeSubst) ->
    SmtConstraints = convert_to_smt_constraints(ArithmeticConstraints),
    cure_smt_solver:solve_constraints(SmtConstraints).
```

**Constraint Types Supported:**
- Equality constraints (`=`)
- Inequality constraints (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`)
- Length equality (`length_eq`) for dependent types
- Subtyping constraints (`<:`, `>:`)
- Bounds constraints for refinement types
- Variance constraints (covariant, contravariant, invariant)

## Current Capabilities

### 1. Dependent Type Support

**Vector Types:**
```cure
type Vector(T, n: Nat) = List(T)

def dot_product(v1: Vector(Float, n), v2: Vector(Float, n)): Float
```

**Constraint Generation:**
- Automatic length constraint inference from list literals
- Pattern matching constraint generation
- Function signature constraint propagation

**Example Constraints Generated:**
```erlang
% For [1.0, 2.0, 3.0] inferred as Vector(Float, n)
length_constraint(vector_length_var, 3)

% For pattern [h|t] where list has length n
arithmetic_constraint(tail_length, =, subtraction([n, 1]))
```

### 2. Arithmetic Constraint Solving

**Supported Operations:**
- Addition (`+`), Subtraction (`-`), Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`), Modulo (`mod`)
- Comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `=`, `/=`)

**Solving Algorithms:**
- **DPLL-style**: Case splitting with unit propagation
- **Constraint simplification**: Tautology elimination, contradiction detection
- **Variable substitution**: Unit constraint application
- **Arithmetic evaluation**: Concrete value computation

### 3. Proof Generation

**Proof Rules Implemented:**
```erlang
% Arithmetic rules
arithmetic_addition, arithmetic_subtraction,
arithmetic_multiplication, arithmetic_division,
arithmetic_modulo, arithmetic_evaluation

% Logical rules  
transitivity, symmetry, reflexivity,
contradiction, assumption
```

**Proof Term Structure:**
```erlang
-record(proof_term, {
    conclusion :: smt_constraint(),
    premises :: [smt_constraint()],
    rule :: atom(),
    subproofs :: [proof_term()]
}).
```

### 4. Pattern Matching Constraints

**List Pattern Inference:**
- Fixed length patterns: `[a, b, c]` → `length = 3`
- Cons patterns: `[h|t]` → `length = 1 + length(t)`
- Wildcard patterns: `[h|_]` → `length >= 1`

**Tail Length Constraints:**
```erlang
% For safe_tail function with pattern [_|xs]
infer_tail_length_constraint(Pattern, OriginalLength, TailLength) ->
    % xs_length = original_length - 1
```

#### 2. Complex Constraints Tests (`test/complex_constraints_test.erl`)

#### 3. SMT Solver Unit Tests

### Example Test Cases

**Vector Type Validation:**
```erlang
% Test Vector(Float, 3) creation and operations
Vec3Type = {dependent_type, 'Vector', [
    #type_param{name = elem_type, value = {primitive_type, 'Float'}},
    #type_param{name = length, value = {literal_expr, 3, undefined}}
]},

% Verify dot product type checking
DotProductType = {function_type, [Vec3Type, Vec3Type], {primitive_type, 'Float'}}
```
