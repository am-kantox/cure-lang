ðŸŽŠ Status: BEAM Code Generation COMPLETE

The Cure programming language now has a complete, working BEAM code generator that can:

1. Compile Cure programs to efficient BEAM bytecode
2. Integrate seamlessly with the BEAM VM ecosystem  
3. Support all language features including dependent types and FSMs
4. Generate optimized code with proper error handling
5. Work with existing tooling in the Erlang/Elixir ecosystem

Next Steps Available:
â€¢  Runtime system integration (hot code loading, distribution)
â€¢  Advanced type-directed optimizations  
â€¢  Standard library development
â€¢  Development tooling (REPL, debugger)
â€¢  Package management integration
