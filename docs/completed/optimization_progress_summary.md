### ‚è≠Ô∏è Remaining Optimization Passes (3)
1. **Dead Code Elimination Using Type Information** (Next priority)
2. **Type-directed BEAM Code Generation**
3. **Type-specific Runtime Optimizations**

## Next Priority: Dead Code Elimination Using Type Information

The next optimization pass to implement is **Dead Code Elimination Using Type Information**, which will use type analysis to identify and remove:
- Unused code paths based on type constraints
- Unreachable branches in pattern matching
- Redundant type checks
- Functions that are provably never called
- Type-specific dead code patterns

This optimization will build upon the solid foundation of the 5 completed optimization passes, leveraging the comprehensive type analysis and usage statistics already collected by the system.
