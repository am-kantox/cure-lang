### 🔧 Core Implementation

The Type-directed BEAM Code Generation pass has been implemented with the following key components:

#### BEAM Instruction Generation
```erlang
%% Type-aware parameter loading
generate_typed_param_loading(Params, FunctionType) ->
    ParamTypes = get_parameter_types(FunctionType),
    lists:zipwith(fun(Param, Type) ->
        case Type of
            {primitive_type, integer} ->
                [#beam_instr{op = load_param_int, args = [Param], location = undefined}];
            {primitive_type, float} ->
                [#beam_instr{op = load_param_float, args = [Param], location = undefined}];
            {primitive_type, atom} ->
                [#beam_instr{op = load_param_atom, args = [Param], location = undefined}];
            _ ->
                [#beam_instr{op = load_param, args = [Param], location = undefined}]
        end
    end, Params, ParamTypes).
```

#### Optimized Calling Conventions
```erlang
%% Type-based calling convention selection
create_optimized_calling_conventions(TypeInfo) ->
    case {is_hot_path_function(FuncName, HotPathFunctions), 
          analyze_function_type_complexity(FuncType)} of
        {true, simple} ->
            #{convention => fast_call, register_args => true, inline_eligible => true};
        {true, moderate} ->
            #{convention => optimized_call, register_args => true, inline_eligible => false};
        {false, simple} ->
            #{convention => register_call, register_args => true, inline_eligible => false};
        {false, complex} ->
            #{convention => standard_call, register_args => false, inline_eligible => false}
    end.
```

#### Type-specialized Opcodes
```erlang
%% Specialized arithmetic operations
generate_specialized_arithmetic_opcode({arithmetic, integer, '+'}) ->
    int_add_optimized;
generate_specialized_arithmetic_opcode({arithmetic, float, '+'}) ->
    float_add_optimized;
generate_specialized_arithmetic_opcode({arithmetic, integer, '*'}) ->
    int_mult_optimized;
generate_specialized_arithmetic_opcode({arithmetic, float, '*'}) ->
    float_mult_optimized.
```
