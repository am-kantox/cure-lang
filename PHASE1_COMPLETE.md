# Phase 1: Wildcard Pattern Typing - COMPLETE ✅

## Summary
Successfully fixed wildcard pattern typing to accept any type without creating restrictive constraints.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added `is_wildcard_name/1` Helper Function
**File**: `src/types/cure_types.erl` (after line 575)

```erlang
%% Check if a name represents a wildcard pattern
%% Wildcard patterns include: _, _dummy, or any identifier starting with _
is_wildcard_name('_') -> true;
is_wildcard_name('_dummy') -> true;
is_wildcard_name(Name) when is_atom(Name) ->
    % Check if name starts with underscore
    NameStr = atom_to_list(Name),
    case NameStr of
        [$_ | _] -> true;
        _ -> false
    end;
is_wildcard_name(_) -> false.
```

### 2. Updated `infer_pattern/1` Function
**File**: `src/types/cure_types.erl` (lines 3195-3224)

- Added handling for `{wildcard_pattern, _Location}`
- Made wildcard identifier patterns create fresh type variables

### 3. Modified `infer_let_expr/4` Function  
**File**: `src/types/cure_types.erl` (lines 3172-3211)

- Added check for wildcard patterns before constraint solving
- Wildcard bindings:
  - Don't add variables to environment
  - Don't create unification constraints
  - Still evaluate the value expression (side effects)
  - Just accumulate value constraints and continue

## Test Results

### Test 1: Wildcard Patterns ✅ PASS
```cure
module Test1 do
  export [test/0]
  
  def test(): Int =
    let _ = {1, 2}
    let _ = []
    let _dummy = {3, 4}
    let _test = [1, 2, 3]
    0
end
```

**Result**: ✅ Successfully compiled to `_build/ebin/Test1.beam`

## Impact

- Wildcard patterns (`_`, `_dummy`, `_anything`) now accept any type
- Statement expressions (unbound function calls) no longer cause type errors
- Resolves the primary type checker limitation preventing compilation

## Remaining Issues

The turnstile example still has errors related to:
- Handler function return types (line 35, 52)
- Unification of `Atom` with `TurnstilePayload` record type
- This is a separate issue from wildcard patterns

These errors are likely related to:
- Phase 2: Any type unification
- Function return type inference
- Record type handling in match expressions

## Next Steps

Proceed to **Phase 2**: Improve Any Type Unification

The wildcard pattern fix is complete and working correctly!
